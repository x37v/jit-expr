JIT expr/expr~/fexpr~
===

The goal of this project is to provide a just-in-time (JIT) version of the
[expr/expr~/fexpr~](http://yadegari.org/expr/expr.html) [pure data](http://puredata.info/) objects.

Build
---

`./configure && make pd`

Notes
---

[godbolt](https://godbolt.org/) can be useful for finding what llvm instruction to use.
`-emit-llvm -S -O0`

Acknowledgements
---

* [Bison Flex C++ Template by RÃ©mi Berson](https://github.com/remusao/Bison-Flex-CPP-template) was the starting point for the tokeniser and parser
* some of the LLVM code is based on the [llvm tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/)
* some of the expr pd code is based on the [original expr code](https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data) by [Shahrokh Yadegari](http://yadegari.org/) and [Miller Puckette](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html)

TODO
===

* remove overloaded virtual warning disable, if we can fix it
* convert more of the functions into LLVM code so it can be further optimized
